ReadMe Summary: This module is a strategic workforce optimization tool designed to slash "Time-to-Revenue." It synchronizes NPPES Registry data with internal credentialing milestones to provide a real-time "Revenue Readiness" score for every provider in the organization.
Key Features:
•	NPPES Effective Date Sync: Pulls the official NPI activation date via API to establish the baseline for legal practice.
•	Payer Lifecycle Tracking: Monitors the delta between credentialing submission and the "Effective Date" for top payers (Medicare, BCBS, United, etc.).
•	Velocity Dashboard Generation: Produces a CSV or JSON report that identifies providers stuck in "pre-revenue" status for longer than the organizational benchmark (e.g., 60 days).
•	Validation Layer: Cross-references NPI taxonomy codes with specialty-specific payer requirements to ensure the provider is being enrolled under the correct billing profile
